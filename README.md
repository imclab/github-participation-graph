========

A simple chrome extension that changes github participation graphs by doing the following:
  * darkens the graphs
  * adds separate colors for owners and contributors (similar to the old colors)

## Installation

Google no longer allows installation outside of the Chrome Web Store, so you will have to install this manually until it's approved and on the store.

Steps:
  1. Fork or clone this repository, eg. `git clone https://github.com/typpo/github-participation-graph.git`
  2. Go to your Chrome Extensions Page (chrome://chrome/extensions/) and enable 'Developer Mode' if not already enabled
  3. 'Load Unpacked Extension' and choose the github-participation-graph directory

## Fork me

This is just 10 lines of js...feel free to add whatever you want or tweak the colors.
